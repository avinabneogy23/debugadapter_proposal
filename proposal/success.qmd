# Success
<!-- 
Projects should have a definition of done that is measurable, and a thorough understanding going in of what the risks are to delivery 
-->

## Definition of Done  
Success will be achieved when:  
1. The `rdap` package is released with full Debug Adapter Protocol (DAP) support for R, including core features like breakpoints, stack traces, variable inspection, and remote debugging.  
2. Compatibility is verified across major IDEs (VS Code, Vim, Emacs) and operating systems (Windows, macOS, Linux).  
3. Comprehensive documentation and tutorials are published to enable adoption by developers and IDE maintainers.  
4. The project is transitioned to the R Consortium or a community-driven maintenance group.  

## Measuring Success  
Progress markers include:  
- **Phase 1 Completion**: Core DAP implementation tested and functional in at least one IDE (Target: Month 6).  
- **Phase 2 Completion**: Advanced debugging features implemented and optimized for performance (Target: Month 12).  
- **Community Adoption**: At least three IDE integrations actively using the `rdap` package (Target: Month 18).  
- **Engagement Metrics**: Positive feedback from workshops, webinars, and UseR! presentations; active GitHub contributions from the community.  

## Future Work  
Potential extensions include:  
- Expanding `rdap` to support additional IDEs and editors beyond the initial targets.  
- Adding features like graphical debugging interfaces or integration with cloud-based R environments.  
- Collaborating with other language communities to improve cross-language debugging workflows in polyglot projects.  
- Supporting remote debugging for distributed R workflows in HPC or cloud environments.
