# Project plan

## Start-up phase

The start-up phase will focus on establishing the foundation for collaboration and project management:  
- **Collaboration Platform**: Set up a GitHub repository with contribution guidelines, issue templates, and a code of conduct (Target: Month 1).  
- **Licensing**: Adopt an open-source license (e.g., MIT) to ensure community-driven development (Target: Month 1).  
- **Reporting Framework**: Define milestones and deliverables with monthly progress updates to the ISC (Target: Month 1). 


## Technical Delivery  
The technical delivery will be divided into three phases with clear timelines:  

1. **Phase 1: Core DAP Implementation (Months 2–6)**  
   - Develop the `rdap` package to implement Debug Adapter Protocol (DAP) for R.  
   - Enable basic debugging features: breakpoints, stack traces, and variable inspection.  
   - Test compatibility with VS Code, Vim, and Emacs.  

2. **Phase 2: Advanced Features & Optimization (Months 7–12)**  
   - Add advanced debugging capabilities: conditional breakpoints, watch variables, and remote debugging.  
   - Optimize performance for large datasets and complex workflows.  
   - Conduct cross-platform testing across Windows, macOS, and Linux.  

3. **Phase 3: Community Handoff (Months 13–18)**  
   - Write comprehensive documentation and tutorials for developers and IDE maintainers.  
   - Engage the R community through workshops, webinars, and blog posts.  
   - Transition maintenance to the R Consortium or a dedicated community group. 

## Other Aspects  

- **Publicity**: Announce the project via an R Consortium blog post and social media (Target: Month 1). Publish progress updates at key milestones.  
- **Community Engagement**: Present at UseR! conferences and host discussion groups to gather feedback during development .  
- **ISC Meetings**: Hold biweekly meetings with the ISC to ensure alignment with project goals and address challenges promptly .
